This demo was written with an old version of the API and has been changed alot since then.
The functionality reached from main.cpp is working the same way.


# How To Get Started

Download the project and run the Setup.bat. Start the generated .sln and run!
Use the ImGui-panel to change settings of the particles.


# About

Small and simple demo of a basic particle system made with 'LFW'.
This demo was made within 2 hours and isn't supposed to be a full on demo, this is just a small example of the API.
